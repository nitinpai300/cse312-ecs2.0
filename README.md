**SOME NOTES FOR PROJECT 2**

**FOR OBJECTIVE 1:**
Please make an account first, go to the feed page, and then try uploading an image in addition to your message (not too large please!!) to test. 

**FOR OBJECTIVE 2:**
TBA

**FOR OBJECTIVE 3:** 
Please navigate to https://environmentcritic.me (or http to test https security). If you upload images, please do NOT upload anything too large. Image uploads do work, but nginx is not very friendly with 5mb+ images. We will address this for our presentation. 

**DISCLAIMER:** Share and Comments do NOT work, we're considering these as future features.
